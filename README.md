# Energy-Prediction-of-Domestic-Appliances-Dataset

The given dataset, "Energy20.txt", can be used to create models of energy use of appliances in a energy-efficient house. The dataset provides the Energy use of appliances (denoted as Y) using 671 samples. It is a modified version of data used in the study [1]. The dataset includes 5 variables, denoted as X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, and Y, described as follows: X1: Temperature in kitchen area, in Celsius X2: Humidity in kitchen area, given as a percentage X3: Temperature outside (from weather station), in Celsius X4: Humidity outside (from weather station), given as a percentage X5: Visibility (from weather station), in km Y: Energy use of appliances, in Wh
